# Rrobot
A twitterbot that tweets about #rstats

This is the source code for [@HappyRrobot](https://twitter.com/HappyRrobot?lang=en), an inoffensive Twitter bot that tweets 
a few times each day something about R.  Typical tweets are retweets of popular recent posts using the `#rstats` hashtag, 
babble based on classic books about R, and text mining summaries from blogs about R.
